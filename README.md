****As a Power BI developer, I've used my skills to create a Fintech Customer Churn Dashboard. 
With Power BI, I turn complex data into easy-to-understand charts and graphs using measure created with DAX in Power BI.
I also created a trackable matrics that are useful to measure performance. This dashboard helps our team track
why customers might leave, so we can stop it. I also make special reports that our team can use to see the data they need.
